pkgdown.offline provides support for offline builds of pkgdown websites,
especially for pkgdown versions >= 2.1.0.

It works by bundling cached frontend dependencies from different pkgdown
versions and implementing drop-in replacements for key functions.
This allows you to build documentation websites in development workflows
or CI/CD pipelines without internet access.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pkgdown.offline from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nanxstats/pkgdown.offline")
```

## Usage

Use `pkgdown.offline::build_site()` and `pkgdown.offline::init_site()`
to replace the original `pkgdown::build_site()` or `pkgdown::init_site()`
calls in your original development or CI/CD workflow.
